CHAPTER:2
TITLE:John 2
SECTION:His First Miracle
LABEL:1
VERSE:And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
LABEL:2
VERSE:and both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
LABEL:5
VERSE:His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
LABEL:8
VERSE:And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.
LABEL:9
VERSE:When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
LABEL:10
VERSE:and saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
LABEL:11
VERSE:This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
LABEL:12
VERSE:After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
SECTION:The First Passover
LABEL:13
VERSE:And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
LABEL:14
VERSE:and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
LABEL:15
VERSE:and when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
LABEL:16
VERSE:and said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
LABEL:19
VERSE:Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
LABEL:21
VERSE:But he spake of the temple of his body.
LABEL:22
VERSE:When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
LABEL:24
VERSE:But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,
LABEL:25
VERSE:and needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
