Driver, Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel, 250-51; cf. NAB “one unmanly”; TEV “fit only to do a woman’s work”; CEV “cowards”). But P. K. McCarter, following an alleged Phoenician usage of the noun to refer to “crutches,” adopts a different view. He translates the phrase “clings to a crutch,” seeing here a further description of physical lameness (II Samuel [AB], 118). Such an idea fits the present context well and is followed by NIV, NCV, and NLT, although the evidence for this meaning is questionable. According to DNWSI 2:915-16, the noun consistently refers to a spindle in Phoenician, as it does in Ugaritic (see UT 468).</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> or one who falls by the sword or one who lacks food!” </span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="2SA.3.30" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">30</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel in Gibeon during the battle.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="2SA.3.31" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">31</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> David instructed Joab and all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes!
