CHAPTER:3
TITLE:1 Corinthians 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able to bear it: nay, not even now are ye able;
LABEL:3
VERSE:for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men?
LABEL:4
VERSE:For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?
LABEL:5
VERSE:What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
LABEL:7
VERSE:So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For we are God’s fellow-workers: ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building.
LABEL:10
VERSE:According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;
LABEL:13
VERSE:each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is.
LABEL:14
VERSE:If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.
LABEL:15
VERSE:If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
LABEL:17
VERSE:If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
LABEL:19
VERSE:For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:
LABEL:20
VERSE:and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;
LABEL:22
VERSE:whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
LABEL:23
VERSE:and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.
